A developer yousuf has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for yousuf. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.



Therefore, create a user named yousuf on the App Server 2. Set expiry date to 2021-03-28 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.
